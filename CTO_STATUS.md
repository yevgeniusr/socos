## 🚨 Top 3 CTO-Level Priorities

### 1. [DONE] AI Agent Phase 3 — LLM Integration ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-04-27 20:35 UTC) — All code migrated from `@anthropic-ai/sdk` → `LlmService` (OpenRouter).

**What was done:**
- Created shared `LlmService` (`llm/llm.service.ts`) with OpenRouter OpenAI-compatible API
- Migrated `AiAgentService` (all 4 tools) from raw Anthropic SDK → `LlmService.complete()`
- Migrated `AiDmService.callAI()` from Anthropic SDK → `LlmService.complete()`
- Migrated `SummaryAgent` (both summary methods) from Anthropic SDK → `LlmService.complete()`
- Removed unused `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `anthropic` npm dependencies
- Updated `.env.example` with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
- Created `PHASE3_LLM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with full documentation
- All services gracefully fall back to template/algorithmic/mock responses when no API key is set

**What's needed to activate:**
```bash
# In services/api/.env:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```
Get a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys. No code changes required.

**Impact:** SOCOS is now "AI-powered relationship assistant" — the core differentiator vs Monica/Twenty. Just needs the API key to go live.

---

### 2. [HIGH] Email/SMS Sending — No Provider Integration
**Why it matters:** Reminders and celebrations need to notify users. The `Reminder` model and `ContactCelebration` model have `shouldRemind` flags and `sendAt` fields, but no email or SMS sending service exists anywhere in the codebase.

**What's needed:**
- Integrate email provider (Resend, SendGrid, or AWS SES)
- Integrate SMS provider (Twilio, AWS SNS)
- Create `NotificationService` in NestJS
- Wire reminder due dates → email/SMS notifications
- Wire celebration dates → email/SMS reminders to user

**Impact:** Users have no way to receive notifications outside the app. Reminders and celebrations are effectively non-functional without this.

---

### 3. [MEDIUM] Auth Frontend Flow + JWT Guard Wiring
**Why it matters:** Auth is implemented server-side (bcrypt + JWT), AuthGuard exists and protects routes, but the frontend has no login/signup UI and doesn't store JWT tokens. NextAuth.js is mentioned as "missing" from package.json.

**What's needed:**
- Add login/signup UI that calls `POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login`
- Store JWT in httpOnly cookie or secure localStorage
- Add `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all authenticated API calls
- Add logout flow (invalidate session + clear token)
- Optionally: migrate to NextAuth.js for session management

**Status note:** AuthGuard IS properly implemented (verifies JWT, sets `request.user`), so backend auth is solid. It's purely a frontend gap.

---

## What Works

### ✅ Completed / Functional
- Contact CRUD with vault-based multi-tenant isolation
- Interaction logging (call, message, meeting, note, email, social) with XP attribution
- Gamification: XP, levels, achievements, streaks
- Celebrations: lunar calendar support, contact-celebration junction with date overrides
- Dungeon Master RPG scenarios (fully implemented with DM session/scene state machine)
- Prisma schema with full relational model
- Docker Compose prod setup with Traefik + SSL
- Backend AuthService (bcrypt + JWT + invite codes)
- AuthGuard for protected routes
- Swagger docs at `/api`
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health/check`
- Unit tests (dungeon-master) + Playwright e2e (web)
- **AI Agent Phase 3**: Full OpenRouter LLM integration (4 tools + DM + summaries) — just needs API key

### ❌ Broken / Missing
- ~~AI Agent system (referenced but not implemented)~~ ✅ DONE
- Email/SMS notification sending
- Login/signup UI in frontend
- JWT token storage/usage in frontend
- Test coverage for auth, contacts, interactions, reminders, gamification, celebrations modules
- Calendar integrations (Google Calendar, Cal.com)
- Analytics & insights dashboard
- WebSocket/real-time updates

## 2026-04-25 Afternoon Audit Update

**Confirmed via source audit:**


- `@socos/platform` (React + Vite) is **still boilerplate** — `App.tsx` renders "Welcome to ts-monorepo-boilerplate" with a logo and shared message. No SOCOS-specific features implemented.
- `AiDmService.callAI()` now uses `LlmService.complete()` via OpenRouter (not Anthropic SDK). Falls back to mock only when OPENROUTER_API_KEY is unset.
- `@socos/web` has a **landing page** (`/`) + dashboard (`/dashboard`) + auth pages (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`) + health-check/setup-db routes.
- Database connection values were previously hardcoded in `docker-compose.prod.yml`; deployment now requires environment-provided credentials.
- Three docker-compose files exist: `docker-compose.yaml` (default), `docker-compose.local.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `docker/Dockerfile.web` is separate from root-level `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yaml` includes a `platform` service (port 8080) not present in `docker-compose.prod.yml` — the platform container is not deployed in prod.


**CTO_STATUS.md assessment:** Existing report (2026-04-25) is accurate. No structural changes needed.

## 2026-04-30 Notification System — IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE — NotificationSchedulerService created and wired into AppModule.

**What was done:**
- Added `@nestjs/schedule` (^6.1.3) dependency to `services/api/package.json`
- Created `NotificationSchedulerService` (`notification-scheduler.service.ts`) with three cron jobs:
  - `check-due-reminders` (every 5 min) — scans for pending reminders in the due window, sends email/SMS
  - `check-upcoming-celebrations` (every hour) — iterates all users with active celebrations, sends notifications
  - `mark-overdue-reminders` (every 30 min) — marks past-due pending reminders as `overdue`
- Created `NotificationSchedulerModule` and wired it into `AppModule` alongside `ScheduleModule.forRoot()`
- Regenerated Prisma client after confirming `ContactCelebration.sendAt` field was present

**How it works:**
- `handleDueReminders`: finds all `pending` reminders with `scheduledAt` in the last 5 minutes, fires `NotificationsService.sendReminderNotification()` for birthday/anniversary/followup types
- `handleUpcomingCelebrations`: for each user with active `shouldRemind=true` celebrations, calls `sendCelebrationNotification()` — delegates actual lunar-date computation to the existing `getGregorianDateForCelebration` logic in `CelebrationsService` by re-implementing the same iteration pattern
- Both gracefully skip when providers (Resend/Twilio) are not configured
- Reminder creation in `RemindersService.create()` already fires `sendReminderNotification` on new creates (async, fire-and-forget)

**What still needs (not blockers for MVP):**
- Real API keys for Resend + Twilio (set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` in production `.env`)
- Actual cron job hosting — the NestJS scheduler runs while the API container is alive; for production resilience, consider an external cron that hits the `/api/notifications/check-due` endpoint
- `getUserPhoneAndSend()` in `NotificationsService` currently returns `null` — needs a real user phone lookup path
